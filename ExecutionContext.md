# Execution context
![](https://github.com/MuraliAirody/JavaScript_Learning_series/assets/71452201/8cd25270-8259-4c58-b0d5-fc393105c4ff)

- Global Execution Context: This is the default or base execution context. Variables and functions that are not inside any function are part of the global execution context. In the diagram, the global execution context initializes variables n, square1, square2, and a function square.

- Function Execution Context: This is created each time a function is invoked or called. In the diagram, the function square is called twice with different arguments (5 and 8), creating separate execution contexts for each call. Each function execution context shows memory allocation and code execution, calculating the square of the input numbers.

- Call Stack: This is the stack data structure that stores all the execution context objects in a LIFO (Last In, First Out) manner. When a function is called, a new execution context is created and added (pushed) to the call stack. When the function returns, its execution context is removed (popped) from the stack. In the diagram, after each function execution, the context is destroyed, returning control to the global context.

- Variable and Function Hoisting: In the global execution context, variables are initially set to undefined and functions are fully defined. This is due to a JavaScript mechanism called hoisting.

- Execution: The code part shows sequential line-by-line code execution including variable assignments and function calls. After the entire code execution is done, the global context will be destroyed.


# Hoisting
Hoisting in JavaScript refers to the behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that you can use a variable or a function in your code before it's declared.

However, it's important to note that only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations. Let's look at examples for both variables and functions:

- Variable Hoisting
```js
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 5;
console.log(x); // Output: 5

```
In the above example, the variable x is hoisted to the top of its scope during compilation. So, even though we try to access it before the declaration, it doesn't throw an error. The first console.log(x) outputs undefined because only the declaration is hoisted, not the assignment.

- Function Hoisting:
```js
foo(); // Output: "Hello, I'm foo!"

function foo() {
  console.log("Hello, I'm foo!");
}
```

In this example, the function foo is hoisted to the top of its scope. So, when we call foo() before its declaration, it works without an error.

However, hoisting does not work the same way with function expressions:
```js
bar(); // TypeError: bar is not a function

var bar = function() {
  console.log("Hello, I'm bar!");
};

```

In this case, the variable bar is hoisted, but it's initialized with undefined. Attempting to call bar() before the assignment results in a TypeError because bar is not yet a function.

#### function invoke creates Local execution context inside Global execution context

#### Once the control reaches back to Global execution context, local execution context will be removed from call stack

#### Same thing repeats with the another function call also

# window 

In a browser environment, when the global execution context is created, it indeed creates a global object, which is typically referred to as window. In this context, window and this both refer to the global object, so window === this is true.

However, within a function execution context, the value of this depends on how the function is called. If a function is a regular function invocation, then this inside the function refers to the global object (window in the browser). However, if the function is a method of an object , the value of this can be different.
```js
console.log(window === this); // true

function exampleFunction() {
  console.log(this === window); // true
}

exampleFunction(); // When called as a regular function, this is the global object

const obj = {
  method: function() {
    console.log(this === obj); // true
  }
};

obj.method(); // When called as a method of an object, this is the object itself

```

# The Scope Chain, ðŸ”¥Scope & Lexical Environment

In JavaScript, the concepts of Scope Chain, Scope, and Lexical Environment are fundamental to understanding how the language handles variables and functions. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of each:

**Scope**: Scope refers to the visibility of variables or functions to the executing code1. In JavaScript, a variable or function is visible to the executing code if it is there in the current lexical environment or in the lexical-environment-chain of the enclosing function1. There are three types of scopes in JavaScript:

**Global Scope**: Variables or functions declared at the top of the code, i.e., in the global space, are said to be in the Global Scope. We can access these variables or functions from anywhere inside our code.
**Local/Function Scope**: When a variable is defined within a function or block, it has a local scope. This means that it can only be accessed within that function or block.
**Block Scope**: ES6 introduced the let and const keywords, which allow variables to have block scope. This means that variables defined within a block of code (such as within an if statement or a for loop) can only be accessed within that block.
**Scope Chain**: The Scope Chain is the hierarchy of scopes that will be searched in order to find a function or variable4. It is the process in which the JavaScript engine searches for the value of the variables in the scope of the functions. However, the search is in a lexical manner.

**Lexical Environment**: The Lexical Environment is the local memory with the lexical environment of its parent (lexical parent - where actually parent physically present in the codes). The chain of the lexical environment references is known as the scope chain5. The scope chain defines whether a variable or function is present inside the scope or not.
